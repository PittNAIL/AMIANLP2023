        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) for clinical and biomedical narratives 
            is one of the well-established, yet rapidly growing and constantly gaining 
            popularity areas of Medical Informatics. As this research field expands, 
            the need for broader community engagement and resource sharing is growing. 
            As a result, AMIA NLP-WG Pre-Symposium became a venue where AMIA researchers 
            with interest in NLP come together and focus on the issues that augment 
            the NLP-oriented presentations and events during AMIA Fall Symposium. 
            These workshops have provided significant learning opportunities for newcomers 
            to the field and have supported advancement of the state-of-the-art and sharing
            of resources and applications. In support of these goals, the AMIA NLP 
            working group pre-symposium continues the tradition since its inception in 2012
            to provide a unique platform for close interactions among students, scholars,
            and industry professionals who are interested in biomedical and clinical NLP. </p> <br> <br>

        <p>This year’s pre-symposium will be divided into three sessions. Session 1 is 
            a graduate student consortium (i.e., ‘doctoral’ consortium also opened to 
            Master students), where students can present their work and get feedback from 
            experienced researchers in the field. Session 2 is a state-of-the-art biomedical 
            and clinical NLP session. We call for abstracts on recent NLP publications, 
            events, tools, resources, shared tasks, and methodology breakthroughs within 
            the past year, highlight and discuss accepted submissions during the session. 
            Session 3 will be an interactive panel session on recent NLP efforts on extracting
            and using the social and behavioral determinants of health (SDOH) information 
            from electronic health records (EHRs). We will discuss the opportunities and 
            challenges and approaches to tackling the challenges as a working group and 
            a community. Each session is planned for 120 minutes. </p>

        <h3>Session 1 – Graduate student consortium (8:30-10:30am)</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the graduate student consortium is to provide opportunities for 
            direct interactions between students and researchers in the biomedical and 
            clinical NLP field, so that students can <br><br>
            1) refine their research focus; <br>
            2) discuss specific questions about study design, algorithm development, or evaluation plan; <br>
            3) receive constructive feedback and suggestions about their dissertation work; and <br>
            4) establish possible collaborations. 
            <br><br>
            We invite advanced graduate students to submit abstracts for a podium presentation 
            of their graduate research work (in the biomedical and clinical NLP fields) to 
            this session.  Abstracts should explain the problem, and its challenges, as well as 
            the novelty and significance of the work. Following peer review, accepted papers 
            will be presented in plenary forums and assessed for:<br><br>
            •	Presentation (slides, speech clarity and rhythm)<br>
            •	Significance (real problem, real people, and potential impact)<br>
            •	Innovation (new or improved, in one field or broader)<br>
            •	Approach (appropriate research design, methods used, and feasibility)<br>
            •	Environment (adequate resources, supervisors/collaborators, guidance)<br>
            <br>
            Four selected students will each have 15 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes 
            for discussion with a panel of established experts and researchers in 
            biomedical and clinical NLP. 
            <br><br>
            This session is chaired by Dr. Abeed Sarker. The well-established NLP researchers serving 
            on the committee are Ozlem Uzuner, Meliha Yetisgen, Hongfang Liu, Hua Xu, Yonghui Wu, 
            Timothy Miller, Justin Rousseau. 
             </p> <br> <br>

        <h3>Session 2 – State-of-the-art biomedical and clinical NLP (11:00-12:00pm, 1:00-2:00pm)</h3>
        <p>We invite researchers to submit their significant research effort in biomedical 
            and clinical NLP, including research studies (published, in press or under development projects), 
            tools, resources, events, and community shared tasks in the past 12 months. The presenters 
            will identify themselves as the corresponding authors during the submission process, and 
            accepted presenters are required to make the presentation themselves. 
            <br> <br>
            Six submissions will be selected to give a 15-minute presentation followed by a 
            5-minute Q&A. This session is chaired by Dr. Yifang Peng.
            </p> <br> <br>

        <h3>Session 3 – NLP for Social and Behavioral Determinants of Health (2:30-4:30pm)</h3>
        <p>Social and behavior determinants of health (SDOH) are the conditions under which people are 
            born, grow, live, work, and age, and include factors such as socioeconomic status, 
            education, employment, lifestyles, social support networks, access to medical care, 
            and neighborhood characteristics. These factors also have a major impact on health equity. 
            With the passing of the HITECH Act in 2009, there has been increased emphasis on use of EHRs 
            to document SDOH. While SDOH exist in structured EHRs, SDOH are primarily documented in 
            free-text clinical notes. NLP is the key technology to extract SDOH from clinical notes 
            and make such information useful for clinical and translational research. This panel will
            encompass the current research and issues of NLP technologies for extracting and using SDOH 
            from EHRs to facilitate clinical and translational research and to improve clinical care 
            and health equity. 
            <br><br>
            The panelist includes Dr. Rui Zhang from the University of Minnesota, Dr. Masoud Rouhizadeh 
            from the University of Florida, Dr. Yanshan Wang from the University of Pittsburgh,
            Dr. Meliha Yetisgen from the University of Washington, Dr. Elham Hatef from 
            the Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Alec Chapman from the University of Utah. 
            <br><br>
            Dr. Kirk Roberts from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston will moderate 
            this session. Each panelist will have 10 minutes to present, followed by 60 minutes interactive discussion.

            •	Research Results to Date - You are not required to have results. But if you already have
             some, present them here.<br>
