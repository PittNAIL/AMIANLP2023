		As such, it is critical to take an engineering-oriented approach to prompt design and evaluation.

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in everyday life has rapidly 
            progressed over the past decades. This progress has been enabled by the availability 
            of tools, large language models (LLMs), and resources that could be shared, reused, and 
            fine-tuned to support users’ projects and collaborations. Today, recently evolved 
            generative AI is being integrated into general search and 
            workplace productivity tools. Applying NLP to the textual content of patient 
            electronic health records (i.e., clinical text) is constrained by strict patient 
            privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations. These domain-specific peculiarities 
            for access and sharing of resources (e.g., annotated text corpora) and 
            ools (e.g., trained machine learning algorithms) require creative solutions. 
            Despite these privacy restrictions, many research teams have succeeded in developing 
            novel biomedical and clinical NLP methods, creating and then sharing resources 
            based on clinical text in a thoughtful and sustainable manner. Despite the legal 
            specifics surrounding patient data, NLP-based technologies have permeated clinical 
            and translational research. Our general objective with this pre-symposium is (1) to 
            provide a platform for the next generation of biomedical NLP scientists to get focused 
            feedback on their in-progress graduate work from a panel of senior academicians, 
            (2) to demonstrate and train the latest achievements, resources, and tools within 
            the biomedical and clinical NLP community along with their reusability, portability, and 
            interoperability with a particular focus on ChatGPT and prompt engineering, 
            (3) provide a forum for people to quickly present their work, providing awareness 
        and opportunities for networking and collaboration within the AMIA NLP community. </p> 
        <br> <br>

        <p> The pre-symposium will be divided into three sessions. 
            Session 1 is a graduate student consortium (i.e., open to both Doctoral candidates and Master’s level students), 
            where students can present their work and get feedback from experienced researchers in the field. 
            Session 2 is a lighting talks session feasuring state-of-the-art biomedical and clinical NLP applications and methodologies&nbsp; . In Session 3 , we will present a 
        tutorial on ChatGPT and prompt engineering for biomedical and clinical NLP tasks.</p>

        <h3>Session 1 – Graduate student consortium (100 minutes)</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the graduate student consortium is to provide opportunities for 
            direct interactions between students and researchers in the biomedical and 
            clinical NLP field, so that students can <br><br>
            1) refine their research focus; <br>
            2) discuss specific questions about study design, algorithm development, or evaluation plan; <br>
            3) receive constructive feedback and suggestions about their dissertation work; and <br>
            4) establish possible collaborations. 
            <br><br>
            We invite advanced graduate students to submit abstracts for a podium presentation 
            of their graduate research work (in the biomedical and clinical NLP fields) to 
            this session.  Abstracts should explain the problem, and its challenges, as well as 
            the novelty and significance of the work. Following peer review, accepted papers 
            will be presented in plenary forums and assessed for:<br><br>
            •	Presentation (slides, speech clarity and rhythm)<br>
            •	Significance (real problem, real people, and potential impact)<br>
            •	Innovation (new or improved, in one field or broader)<br>
            •	Approach (appropriate research design, methods used, and feasibility)<br>
            •	Environment (adequate resources, supervisors/collaborators, guidance)<br>
            <br>
            Four selected students will each have 15 minutes for presentation and 10 minutes 
            for discussion with a panel of established experts and researchers in 
            biomedical and clinical NLP. 
            <br><br>
            This session is chaired by Dr. Masoud Rouhizadeh from the University of Florida. 
            The well-established NLP researchers serving 
            on the committee are Ozlem Uzuner, Meliha Yetisgen, Hongfang Liu, Hua Xu, Stephane Meystre, 
            Chunhua Weng, and Timothy Miller, though we may invite new panelists, as needed.
             </p> <br> <br>

		
        <h3>Session 2 – Lightening Talks on the State-of-the-art biomedical and clinical NLP (30 minutes) </h3>
        <p>A selection of existing and significant NLP related efforts will be highlighted in this session, as well as presentation of late breaking research and preliminary collaboration-seeking efforts. Researchers can submit their research effort including research studies (published, in press or under development projects), tools, resources, events, and community shared tasks in the past 12 months (or a proposal seeking collaborators for future projects). 
            All NLP year-in-review submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:<br><br>
            •	Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to NLP-WG,<br>
            •	Impact of the paper(s) on informatics/medicine/biology (while the impact of papers on science is not fully reflected by ISI/Google-like impact factors or a high number of downloads, high values in such factors will clearly stand as a strong argument for acceptance),<br>
            •	"Presentability" of the work to a large, diverse audience,<br>
            •	Quality of oral presentations by the submitter (if known),<br>
            •	Submissions that permit the presentation of related interesting unpublished new results will be viewed favorably.<br>
            •	Quality of proposed idea, if seeking collaborators or networking <br><br>

            Up to six submissions will be selected to give 5-minute presentations. The session Chair will be Dr. Satya Sahoo from the Case Western Reserve University.<br>
            
            </p> <br> <br>
		
        <h3>Session 3 – Tutorial: ChatGPT and Prompt Engineering (60 minutes) </h3>
        <p>ChatGPT and other large language models have brought a new state-of-the-art 
            paradigm of generative large language models to the forefront with its widespread 
            adoption in modern search engines and workplace productivity software. Other similar 
            generative NLP models have been developed for healthcare, including Med-PaLM and BioGPT. 
            These technologies are still in their infancy and lack widespread adoption in the 
            healthcare industry, partially due to a skills gap in the AMIA NLP community and 
            partly due to technical, conceptual, and ethical limitations of current LLM technologies. 
            To be competitive in the future job market, NLP practitioners will need to learn prompt 
            engineering skills in order to optimally release the power of these large generative 
            language models as well as to steer their adoption in the healthcare enterprise in 
            responsible and appropriate directions. The goal of this tutorial is to walk through basic 
            clinical NLP uses cases, share lessons learned on how to optimize prompts, and discuss 
            the pros and cons of adopting generative AI models in practice. <br><br>
			
			The instructors will be Dr. Steven Bedrick and his team from the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU).
