        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in everyday life has rapidly 
            progressed over the past decades. This progress has been enabled by the availability 
            of tools, large language models, and resources that could be shared, reused, and 
            fine-tuned to support users’ projects and collaborations. Today, recently evolved 
            large generative language models are being integrated into general search and 
            workplace productivity tools. Applying NLP to the textual content of patient 
            electronic health records (i.e., clinical text) is constrained by strict patient 
            privacy and confidentiality laws and regulations. These domain-specific peculiarities 
            for access and sharing of resources (e.g., annotated text corpora) and t
            ools (e.g., trained machine learning algorithms) require creative solutions. 
            Despite these privacy restrictions, many research teams have succeeded in developing 
            novel biomedical and clinical NLP methods, creating and then sharing resources 
            based on clinical text in a thoughtful and sustainable manner. Despite the legal 
            specifics surrounding patient data, NLP-based technologies have permeated clinical 
            and translational research. Our general objective with this pre-symposium is (1) to 
            provide a platform for the next generation of biomedical NLP scientists to get focused 
            feedback on their in-progress graduate work from a panel of senior academicians, 
            (2a) to demonstrate and train the latest achievements, resources, and tools within 
            the biomedical and clinical NLP community along with their reusability, portability, and 
            interoperability with a particular focus on ChatGPT and prompt engineering, 
            (2b) provide a forum for people to quickly present their work, providing awareness 
            and opportunities for networking and collaboration within the AMIA NLP community, 
            and (3) to discuss ethical issues related to the emerging NLP technologies, 
            especially as they relate to the healthcare industry (and adjunct industries).  </p> <br> <br>

        <p> The pre-symposium will be divided into three sessions. 
            Session 1 is a graduate student consortium (i.e., open to both Doctoral candidates and Master’s level students), 
            where students can present their work and get feedback from experienced researchers in the field. 
            Session 2 is a state-of-the-art biomedical and clinical NLP session. In the first half, we will present a 
            tutorial on ChatGPT and prompt engineering. The second half will be a series of short lightening talks by 
            NLP community members. Session 3 will be an interactive panel session on AI ethics related to NLP, and e
            specially the new generative AI models such as ChatGPT. We will discuss the opportunities and challenges 
            and approaches to tackling ethics challenges as a working group and a community. Each session will be 
            allocated 120 minutes; however, the allocation of time may be adjusted based on the number of presenters 
            and the time needed to cover each section sufficiently.  </p>

        <h3>Session 1 (Interactive) – Graduate student consortium (120 minutes)</h3>
        <p>The purpose of the graduate student consortium is to provide opportunities for 
            direct interactions between students and researchers in the biomedical and 
            clinical NLP field, so that students can <br><br>
            1) refine their research focus; <br>
            2) discuss specific questions about study design, algorithm development, or evaluation plan; <br>
            3) receive constructive feedback and suggestions about their dissertation work; and <br>
            4) establish possible collaborations. 
            <br><br>
            We invite advanced graduate students to submit abstracts for a podium presentation 
            of their graduate research work (in the biomedical and clinical NLP fields) to 
            this session.  Abstracts should explain the problem, and its challenges, as well as 
            the novelty and significance of the work. Following peer review, accepted papers 
            will be presented in plenary forums and assessed for:<br><br>
            •	Presentation (slides, speech clarity and rhythm)<br>
            •	Significance (real problem, real people, and potential impact)<br>
            •	Innovation (new or improved, in one field or broader)<br>
            •	Approach (appropriate research design, methods used, and feasibility)<br>
            •	Environment (adequate resources, supervisors/collaborators, guidance)<br>
            <br>
            Four selected students will each have 15 minutes for presentation and 15 minutes 
            for discussion with a panel of established experts and researchers in 
            biomedical and clinical NLP. 
            <br><br>
            This session is chaired by Dr. Masoud Rouhizadeh from the University of Florida. 
            The well-established NLP researchers serving 
            on the committee are Ozlem Uzuner, Meliha Yetisgen, Hongfang Liu, Hua Xu, Stephane Meystre, 
            Chunhua Weng, and Timothy Miller, though we may invite new panelists, as needed.

        <p>ChatGPT and ChatGPT alike large language models have brought a new state-of-the-art 
            paradigm of generative large language models to the forefront with its widespread 
            adoption in modern search engines and workplace productivity software. Other similar 
            generative NLP models have been developed for healthcare, including Med-PaLM and BioGPT. 
            These technologies are still in their infancy and lack widespread adoption in the 
            healthcare industry, partially due to a skills gap in the AMIA NLP community and 
            partly due to technical, conceptual, and ethical limitations of current LLM technologies. 
            To be competitive in the future job market, NLP practitioners will need to learn prompt 
            engineering skills in order to optimally release the power of these large generative 
            language models as well as to steer their adoption in the healthcare enterprise in 
            responsible and appropriate directions. The goal of this tutorial is to walk through basic 
            clinical NLP uses cases, share lessons learned on how to optimize prompts, and discuss 
            the pros and cons of adopting generative AI models in practice. The instructors will 
            be Dr. Steven Bedrick and his team from the Oregon Health & Science University (OHSU).

        <h3>Session 2b – Lightening Talks on the State-of-the-art biomedical and clinical NLP (60 minutes) </h3>
        <p>A selection of existing and significant NLP related efforts will be highlighted in this session, as well as presentation of late breaking research and preliminary collaboration-seeking efforts. A call for submissions will invite researchers to submit their research effort including research studies (published, in press or under development projects), tools, resources, events, and community shared tasks in the past 12 months (or a proposal seeking collaborators for future projects). The presenters will identify themselves as the corresponding authors during the submission process, and accepted presenters are required to make the presentation themselves. 
            All NLP year-in-review submissions will be evaluated according to the following criteria:<br><br>
            •	Relevance, interest, and value of the topic to NLP-WG,<br>
            •	Impact of the paper(s) on informatics/medicine/biology (while the impact of papers on science is not fully reflected by ISI/Google-like impact factors or a high number of downloads, high values in such factors will clearly stand as a strong argument for acceptance),<br>
            •	"Presentability" of the work to a large, diverse audience,<br>
            •	Quality of oral presentations by the submitter (if known),<br>
            •	Submissions that permit the presentation of related interesting unpublished new results will be viewed favorably.<br>
            •	Quality of proposed idea, if seeking collaborators or networking <br><br>

            These "soft" criteria attempt to capture the underlying goal of the Highlight session, namely the presentation of exciting and thought-provoking efforts in advancing NLP in the biomedical and clinical domain. The purpose of the presentations and demonstrations is to provide opportunities for the biomedical and clinical NLP community to discover and share state-of-the-art knowledge and eventually encourage scientific and technical progress in the field. Up to eight submissions will be selected to give 5-minute presentations followed by a 15-minute open discussion and networking period. The session Chair will be Dr. Satya Sahoo from the Case Western Reserve University.<br>

        <h3>Session 3 (Interactive) – AI Ethics Panel (120 minutes)</h3>
        <p>AI Ethics, specifically related to NLP, has been an under-discussed topic within 
            the AMIA NLP community. The recent widespread adoption of AI models, which have 
            a tendency to “make up” facts and sound confident about their output raises 
            specific issues in the fact-oriented field of medicine, where one hopes 
            colloquially to “not die of a misprint” (though this is a real and present 
            danger and the focus of patient safety/adverse event research). Similarly 
            troubling is the ease at which misinformation may be generated by large 
            language models (e.g., ChatGPT), which can sound authoritative and can provide 
            citations (which don’t actually match the information provided). Informed consent 
            is another issue in clinical NLP research since we often extract personal 
            information from EHRs that is not covered by HIPAA without patients’ consent. 
            We will explore these topics specifically, but also allow panelists/participants 
            to raise and discuss on other relevant ethical issues as well. <br><br>

            This section of the presentation is being led by the 
            Bridge2AI team, which is an AMIA NLP working group sponsored focus group on 
            AI ethics. We will seek participation and co-sponsorship for this session 
            from the AMIA Ethics, Legal, and Social Issues working group. The moderator for 
            this session will be Dr. Kirk Roberts from the Bridge2AI team. The panelists include: 
            Dr. Hongfang Liu (Mayo Clinic), Dr. Xiaoqian Jiang (UT Health), Dr. Camille Nebeker (UC San Diego). 
            Each panelist will have 10 minutes to present, followed by 60 minutes interactive discussion.
